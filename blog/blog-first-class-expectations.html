    <h1>What to Expect at Your First Class</h1>

    <p>Starting something new can be intimidating — especially martial arts. Whether you’re an adult stepping onto the mat for the first time or a parent bringing your child, this post will walk you through exactly what to expect at your first class with Dragon Fist MMA.</p>

    <h2>1. No Gear Needed</h2>
    <p>For your first class, just wear comfortable workout clothes — t-shirt and shorts are perfect. We train barefoot on clean mats, so no shoes are necessary. If you decide to join, we’ll talk about uniforms and optional gear later.</p>

    <h2>2. Warm Welcome</h2>
    <p>You’ll be greeted by one of our instructors (usually Rob or Matt) and introduced to the group. If you're a parent, you're welcome to observe from the sidelines or ask questions before or after class.</p>

    <h2>3. A Guided Experience</h2>
    <p>We won’t throw you into sparring! First classes focus on movement, footwork, and simple techniques. You’ll go at your own pace and get one-on-one attention where needed. The vibe is friendly, respectful, and focused.</p>

    <h2>4. Kids Thrive with Structure</h2>
    <p>Our youth classes are structured and positive. Expect your child to participate in warm-ups, practice drills, and partner exercises — all geared toward building confidence, listening skills, and focus.</p>

    <h2>5. Everyone Sweats</h2>
    <p>Whether you're 7 or 70, martial arts is a full-body workout. Expect to move, stretch, balance, and engage muscles you forgot you had — but always at your own level.</p>

    <h2>6. You’ll Leave Smiling</h2>
    <p>Most first-timers walk off the mat feeling energized, proud, and a little sweaty. The most common feedback we hear? “That was way more fun than I expected.”</p>

    <p>Still unsure? Reach out with any questions or just <a href="/DFMMA/contact.html" style="color: #e63946;">schedule your free trial class</a>. We’ll take it from there.</p>
